In the previous article, we've figured out how typical ICOs work from a technical POV, picked up the proper toolbox for development, and learned how to deal with potential EVM problems.

Now itâ€™s time to write an actual Dutch Auction in Solidity!

<!--more-->

From the Wikipedia's definition of [Dutch Auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_auction):

> Most commonly, it means an auction in which the auctioneer begins with a high asking price, and lowers it until some participant accepts the price, or it reaches a predetermined reserve price.

A Dutch Auction has several advantages over a classic crowdsale:

- Allows participation that does not offer price advantages to wealthier participants.
- Allows participation from those who wish to buy large amounts, to participate fairly.
- Ensures extended purchasing event period to prevent network delays, long queues, and price advantages to those who can afford to pay more gas.
- Prioritizes the number of participants over the number of dollars raised

Just like a real-life auction, we have to accept the bids to-be-claimed-later and save them in contract storage. In every bid we have to fix current token price, stake amount, and have a couple of helper notes (e.g. whether bid tokens were already claimed or the bid was placed using Bitcoin donation):

```solidity
contract DutchAuction is PriceDecay150 { 
    // Auction Bid 
    struct Bid {
        uint256 price; 
        uint256 transfer; 
        bool placed; 
        bool claimed; 
        bool isBitcoin;
    }

// Address to bid mapping 
mapping (address => Bid) public bids; 
```

As you can notice, a Dutch Auction in Ethereum is as simple as a [ERC20 Token](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) â€” main variable called bids defines the details of the bid, placed by a specific Ethereum address.

This, however, introduces us to the first limitation â€” **only a single bid can be placed by a unique address**. Of course, we can modify our mapping to store an array of bids per address and then add additional loops in placing / claiming functions. But this complication will increase the overall contract interaction gas costs (because of [expensive storage](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/896/31032)) and gas costs for each new address bid. To avoid the unnecessary increase in cost per user, we delegate this problem to our fellow bidders â€” generating a new address in almost every Ethereum wallet is as easy as a couple of mouse clicks!

Every real-life Dutch Auction is split into two main stages â€” the bidding process and the actual goods selling after the final price is set. Obviously, you canâ€™t sell anything before the bidding has started and you canâ€™t accept the bids after the price is finalized. These kinds of security limitations can be achieved through Solidityâ€™s [enumerations](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.21/types.html#enums) and [function modifiers](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.21/common-patterns.html#restricting-access):

```solidity
// Auction Stages
enum Stages {
    AuctionDeployed, 
    AuctionStarted, 
    AuctionEnded, 
    TokensDistributed
} 

// Current stage 
Stages public current_stage;

// Stage modifier 
modifier atStage(Stages _stage) { 
    require(current_stage == _stage); 
} 
```

After the auction contract is deployed to the network, it will have initial `AuctionDeployed` state. Then, `startAuction()` method will be called by the contract owner, allowing investors to place bids using [default fallback function](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.21/contracts.html#fallback-function) `()`. Under some conditions, stage will be changed to AuctionEnded, allowing participants to start claiming their tokens by calling `claimTokens()` function. Every function listed above is limited by `atStage` modifier, which will throw EVM error and return any transferred funds back to the sender if the stage is incorrect:

```solidity
// Setup auction 
function startAuction(
    address _tokenAddress, 
    uint256 offering, 
    uint256 bonus
) external isOwner atStage (Stages.AuctionDeployed) {
    // Setup logic
} 
 
// Default fallback function 
function () public payable atStage(Stages.AuctionStarted) { 
    placeBidGeneric(msg.sender, msg.value, false); 
} 

// Claim tokens 
function claimTokens() external atStage(Stages.AuctionEnded) {
    // Claim logic
} 
```

Why not start an auction immediately after the contract is deployed? In `startAuction()`, weâ€™re creating a `ShopToken` instance using itâ€™s address in order to automatically transfer tokens to their owners. But this can be done directly in the constructor function, which implies that `ShopToken` contract is deployed before `DutchAuction`. We've decided to do it vice versa, ensuring the auction contract receives specified number of tokens for sale, using scriptable [Truffle migrations](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/running-migrations):

```javascript
// Deploy contracts and start auction 
deployer.deploy(
    DutchAuction, 
    priceStart, 
    pricePrecision, 
    minimumBid, 
    claimPeriod, 
    walletAddress
).then(
    deployer.deploy(
        ShopToken, 
        DutchAuction.address, 
        initialSupply, 
        auctionSupply
    ).then(function() { 
        DutchAuction.deployed().then(
            function(instance) { 
                instance.startAuction(
                    ShopToken.address, 
                    offering.toString(), 
                    bonus.toString()
                )
            }
        )
    )
);
```

So far, weâ€™ve learned the core concepts of a Dutch Auction and its representation in the Solidity language. In the next part, we will deal with the exponential price decay, Bitcoin-funded bids, and DApp development problems.
