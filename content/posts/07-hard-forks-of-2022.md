#### Footnotes

1. Related to [Binance Smart Chain hack](https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1578140914283065344) worth of ~$600M.
2. Algorand [protocol upgrade date](https://www.algorand.foundation/news/v2-upgrade-process) is approximate: 

    > The upgrade process includes a threshold where 90% or more of the block proposers state that they are ready for the next consensus version. Once the 90% threshold is met, everyone with the new binary now switches to speaking in the new consensus version at a point that is 10,000 block marks from when the 90% threshold occurs.
