Following [26 hard forks in 2023]({{< ref 06-hard-forks-of-2023 >}}), there will be at least 6 planned protocol upgrades coming this year. Giant kudos to Bitcoin Cash development team, giving 6 months notice once again!

#### Footnotes

1. Algorand [protocol upgrade date](https://www.algorand.foundation/news/v2-upgrade-process) is approximate: 

    > The upgrade process includes a threshold where 90% or more of the block proposers state that they are ready for the next consensus version. Once the 90% threshold is met, everyone with the new binary now switches to speaking in the new consensus version at a point that is 10,000 block marks from when the 90% threshold occurs.
