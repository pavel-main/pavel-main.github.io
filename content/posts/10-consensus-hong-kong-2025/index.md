## Prologue

Just a 12-hour flight from London over a half of the world and here we are at Hong Kong, the bridge between the West and the East! 

The very first day of the event, February 18, wasn't dedicated to a real conferencing - [instead there was a couple of rooftop opening parties](https://consensus-hongkong2025.coindesk.com/agenda/-date/2025-02-18), with RSVPs sold out a long time ago. 

Bummer, however our team have hosted a [separate event](https://lu.ma/m8cp6j1p) in the middle of the event, at the very same rooftop called [Faye](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eBEEQNYZGgd5C8Bg6) right in the Central Hong Kong. Giant kudos to Matt & Ryan for organizing!

## Day 1 - Emerging Protocols

A vibe is something that's easier to show rather than tell, so I'll be injecting a bunch of videos captured by my [Ray-Ban / Meta Smart Glasses](https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses)

  ```shell
  $ ffmpeg -i <input.mov> -vcodec h264 -acodec aac <output.mp4>
